    You are a QA expert proficient in cypress and playwright. Please help me modify my target test file and related files based on the page snapshot.
    **IMPORTANT: Please focus on fixing the code and do not write any .md files.**

    Please note:
    1. Cypress does not have pseudo-syntax like :has-text. Please use cy.contains() syntax to achieve equivalent functionality.
    2. Do not use 'generic' as a selector. In Playwright, use role-based selectors directly; in Cypress, use cy.contains directly.
    3. If there is an input field, please pay attention to whether it's an input or textarea element.
