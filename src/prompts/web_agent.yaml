    Please help me read the test file at {test_file_path} and execute the test content using the playwright mcp tool. The file content may contain errors. If you cannot find an element with the corresponding selector, please help me find the element with the closest semantic meaning to interact with.
    If you need base_url or config information, you can find it in the cypress.config.js file.
    You must create todos to track task progress.
    And after each todo, add a fix code todo to use snapshot information to fix my {test_file_path} and its related files.
    
    Modification guidelines:
    1. Please focus on fixing selector, contains() and other locator information
    2. Please fix the code immediately after completing each step
